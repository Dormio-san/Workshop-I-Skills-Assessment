# Workshop-I-Skills-Assessment
My Unreal project for the skills assessment in my workshop I class.
Due to issues with file size and remedies not working, the project is not on here. If you want to see the build, you can check it out on itch here: https://dormio-san.itch.io/small-demo.
Additionally, feel free to go back to a previous commit to see the last version of the project that I was able to push.
